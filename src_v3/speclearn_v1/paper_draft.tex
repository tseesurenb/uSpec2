\begin{abstract}
Spectral collaborative filtering has shown promising results by leveraging graph spectral analysis to capture collaborative signals in user-item interactions. However, existing approaches rely on fixed, hand-crafted spectral filters that cannot adapt to diverse dataset characteristics. We introduce the first learnable spectral filtering framework for collaborative filtering, where both spectral filters and spatial-spectral fusion weights are learned end-to-end. Our approach employs Bernstein polynomial basis functions to parameterize learnable filters that can approximate arbitrary frequency responses, while automatically discovering the optimal balance between global spectral signals and local spatial propagation. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we demonstrate that our learned filters consistently outperform fixed spectral approaches and successfully adapt to dataset-specific characteristics—emphasizing spectral filtering for small, sparse datasets and spatial propagation for large, dense ones. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while providing interpretable insights into collaborative filtering dynamics.

\section{Introduction}

Collaborative filtering (CF) forms the backbone of modern recommender systems, with graph-based methods achieving remarkable success by modeling user-item interactions as bipartite graphs~\cite{he2020lightgcn,wang2019neural}. Among these, spectral collaborative filtering has emerged as a powerful paradigm that leverages graph spectral analysis to capture both local and global collaborative patterns~\cite{zheng2020spectral,liu2021gfcf}.

Traditional spectral CF methods decompose user-item similarity matrices into eigenvalue-eigenvector pairs and apply fixed spectral filters to emphasize or suppress different frequency components~\cite{liu2021gfcf}. These approaches have shown that low-frequency components (corresponding to large eigenvalues) capture smooth, global collaborative signals, while high-frequency components often contain noise. However, existing methods suffer from a fundamental limitation: they rely on \textbf{fixed, hand-crafted spectral filters} that cannot adapt to diverse dataset characteristics.

Consider the challenge faced by current spectral CF: small, sparse datasets (e.g., MovieLens-100K) benefit from sophisticated spectral analysis to extract weak collaborative signals, while large, dense datasets (e.g., Yelp2018) may be better served by simple spatial propagation. Yet existing approaches use the same fixed filter across all scenarios, leaving significant performance on the table.

We address this limitation by introducing the \textbf{first learnable spectral filtering framework} for collaborative filtering. Our key contributions are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Learnable Spectral Filters}: We parameterize spectral filters using Bernstein polynomial basis functions, enabling end-to-end learning of arbitrary frequency responses that adapt to dataset characteristics.
    
    \item \textbf{Adaptive Spectral-Spatial Fusion}: We introduce a learnable weighting mechanism that automatically discovers the optimal balance between global spectral filtering and local spatial propagation.
    
    \item \textbf{Multi-view Learning}: Our framework learns separate filters for user, item, and bipartite views with view-specific optimization, capturing the distinct collaborative patterns in each perspective.
    
    \item \textbf{Empirical Validation}: Through comprehensive experiments, we show that our learned filters consistently outperform fixed approaches and demonstrate clear adaptation to dataset characteristics.
\end{itemize}

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Graph-based Collaborative Filtering}
Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have revolutionized collaborative filtering by treating user-item interactions as graph signals~\cite{berg2017graph,ying2018graph}. LightGCN~\cite{he2020lightgcn} simplified the architecture by removing feature transformations and nonlinear activations, focusing purely on neighborhood aggregation. Recent work has explored various propagation schemes~\cite{wang2019neural,he2022simplifying} and graph augmentation strategies~\cite{wu2021self}.

\subsection{Spectral Collaborative Filtering}
Spectral methods apply graph signal processing principles to collaborative filtering. SpectralCF~\cite{zheng2020spectral} first introduced spectral analysis for CF, while GF-CF~\cite{liu2021gfcf} provided theoretical foundations connecting graph filtering to recommendation performance. However, these methods use fixed spectral filters—typically ideal low-pass or hand-tuned polynomial filters—that cannot adapt to different datasets.

Recent work has explored learnable normalization~\cite{wang2022polycf} and different aggregation schemes~\cite{sun2023ultra}, but the fundamental spectral filters remain fixed. Our work is the first to make the spectral filters themselves learnable.

\subsection{Learnable Graph Filters}
In the broader graph signal processing community, learnable filters have been explored for node classification~\cite{kipf2016semi} and graph classification~\cite{xu2018powerful}. However, these approaches focus on supervised learning with node/graph labels, while collaborative filtering presents unique challenges: (1) implicit feedback signals, (2) bipartite graph structure, and (3) the need to balance local and global patterns for recommendation quality.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Problem Formulation}

Let $\mathbf{R} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}$ denote the user-item interaction matrix, where $n$ and $m$ are the numbers of users and items, respectively. We construct similarity matrices for different views:
\begin{align}
\mathbf{S}_u &= \mathbf{D}_u^{-1/2} \mathbf{R} \mathbf{D}_i^{-1/2} (\mathbf{D}_u^{-1/2} \mathbf{R} \mathbf{D}_i^{-1/2})^T \\
\mathbf{S}_i &= (\mathbf{D}_u^{-1/2} \mathbf{R} \mathbf{D}_i^{-1/2})^T \mathbf{D}_u^{-1/2} \mathbf{R} \mathbf{D}_i^{-1/2} \\
\mathbf{S}_b &= \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{0} & \mathbf{R}_{norm} \\ \mathbf{R}_{norm}^T & \mathbf{0} \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
where $\mathbf{D}_u$ and $\mathbf{D}_i$ are degree matrices for users and items.

Each similarity matrix is decomposed as $\mathbf{S}_v = \mathbf{V}_v \mathbf{\Lambda}_v \mathbf{V}_v^T$, where $\mathbf{\Lambda}_v = \text{diag}(\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_k)$ contains the $k$ largest eigenvalues and $\mathbf{V}_v$ contains corresponding eigenvectors.

\subsection{Learnable Spectral Filters}

Traditional spectral CF applies fixed filters $h(\lambda)$ to eigenvalues. We instead parameterize filters using Bernstein polynomials:

\begin{equation}
h_v(\lambda; \boldsymbol{\theta}_v) = \sum_{j=0}^{p-1} \theta_{v,j} B_j^{(p-1)}(\lambda)
\end{equation}

where $B_j^{(n)}(\lambda) = \binom{n}{j} \lambda^j (1-\lambda)^{n-j}$ are Bernstein basis functions, $p$ is the filter order, and $\boldsymbol{\theta}_v$ are learnable coefficients for view $v$.

Bernstein polynomials have several advantages:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Universal approximation}: Can approximate any continuous function on $[0,1]$
    \item \textbf{Numerical stability}: Well-conditioned basis functions
    \item \textbf{Interpretability}: Coefficients directly control filter shape
\end{itemize}

We apply softmax normalization to coefficients: $\tilde{\theta}_{v,j} = \text{softmax}(\theta_{v,j}) \cdot p$ to ensure reasonable filter responses.

\subsection{Multi-view Spectral Filtering}

For each view $v \in \{u, i, b\}$ (user, item, bipartite), we apply learnable filters:

\textbf{User View:}
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{Y}_u = \mathbf{P}_u \text{diag}(h_u(\boldsymbol{\lambda}_u)) \mathbf{P}_u^T \mathbf{X}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Item View:}
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{Y}_i = \mathbf{X} \mathbf{V}_i \text{diag}(h_i(\boldsymbol{\lambda}_i)) \mathbf{V}_i^T
\end{equation}

\textbf{Bipartite View:}
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{Y}_b = \mathbf{P}_b \text{diag}(h_b(\boldsymbol{\lambda}_b)) \mathbf{P}_b^T \mathbf{X}
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{X}$ represents user profiles, $\mathbf{P}_u$ and $\mathbf{P}_b$ are user-specific eigenvector matrices, and $\mathbf{Y}_v$ are filtered outputs.

\subsection{Spectral-Spatial Fusion}

To combine spectral filtering with spatial propagation, we introduce a learnable fusion mechanism:

\begin{align}
\mathbf{Y}_{spectral} &= \frac{1}{|V|} \sum_{v \in V} \mathbf{Y}_v \\
\mathbf{Y}_{spatial} &= \mathbf{X} \mathbf{A}_{norm}^T \mathbf{A}_{norm} \\
\mathbf{Y}_{final} &= \mathbf{Y}_{spectral} + w \cdot \mathbf{Y}_{spatial}
\end{align}

where $V$ is the set of active views, $\mathbf{A}_{norm}$ is the normalized adjacency matrix, and $w$ is a learnable weight parameter.

\subsection{Optimization}

We employ view-specific learning rates to handle the different optimization landscapes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item User filter: $\eta_u = 0.1$ (aggressive, handles sparse signals)
    \item Item filter: $\eta_i = 0.01$ (conservative, dense similarities)  
    \item Bipartite filter: $\eta_b = 0.05$ (moderate, balanced structure)
    \item Fusion weight: $\eta_w = 0.01$ (stable convergence)
\end{itemize}

Training minimizes mean squared error:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = \|\mathbf{Y}_{final} - \mathbf{T}\|_F^2 + \sum_{v} \lambda_v \|\boldsymbol{\theta}_v\|_2^2
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{T}$ is the target matrix with $T_{ui} = 1$ for observed interactions.

\end{table}

Key observations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Adaptation to dataset size}: Our method automatically learns to emphasize different components—spectral for small datasets (ML-100K), spatial for large datasets (Yelp2018).
    
    \item \textbf{Consistent improvements}: Learnable fusion outperforms both pure spectral and pure spatial approaches across all datasets.
    
    \item \textbf{View complementarity}: Different views contribute differently—user view helps on sparse data, item view dominates on dense data.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ablation Studies}

\textbf{Filter Order:} We study the effect of Bernstein polynomial order $p \in \{4, 6, 8, 10, 12\}$. Performance peaks at $p=8$, providing sufficient expressiveness without overfitting.

\textbf{Learning Rate Analysis:} View-specific learning rates prove crucial. Using uniform learning rates degrades performance by 2-5\% across datasets.

\textbf{Eigenvalue Count:} We analyze the impact of eigenvalue counts $k_u, k_i, k_b$. Optimal values correlate with dataset size—small datasets need fewer eigenvalues (25-50), large datasets benefit from more (200-400).

\subsection{Learned Filter Analysis}

Figure~\ref{fig:learned_filters} visualizes learned filter responses across datasets. Key insights:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{ML-100K}: Filters emphasize mid-frequency components, extracting collaborative signals from sparse data.
    
    \item \textbf{Yelp2018}: Filters approach low-pass behavior, focusing on strong collaborative patterns.
    
    \item \textbf{Gowalla}: Filters show mixed responses, balancing global and local patterns.
\end{itemize}

The learned fusion weights also adapt predictably: $w = 0.2$ for ML-100K (spectral-dominated), $w = 1.65$ for Yelp2018 (spatial-dominated).

\section{Theoretical Analysis}

\subsection{Approximation Capacity}

Our Bernstein polynomial filters have strong theoretical guarantees. By the Weierstrass approximation theorem, any continuous function on $[0,1]$ can be uniformly approximated by Bernstein polynomials:

\begin{theorem}[Approximation Bound]
For any continuous function $f: [0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and Bernstein polynomial $B_p f$ of degree $p$, the approximation error satisfies:
$$\|f - B_p f\|_\infty \leq \frac{3}{2} \omega_f\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{p}}\right)$$
where $\omega_f$ is the modulus of continuity.
\end{theorem}

This ensures our learnable filters can approximate any desired frequency response given sufficient order.

\subsection{Convergence Analysis}

Under standard assumptions (Lipschitz loss, bounded gradients), our multi-view optimization converges to a critical point. The view-specific learning rates help navigate the different optimization landscapes—user similarities are often rank-deficient while item similarities are better conditioned.

\section{Conclusion}

We introduced the first learnable spectral filtering framework for collaborative filtering, addressing a fundamental limitation of existing spectral methods. Our approach automatically adapts to dataset characteristics, learning both optimal spectral filters and spectral-spatial fusion weights. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrated consistent improvements over fixed spectral methods and competitive performance with neural approaches.

Key contributions include: (1) learnable Bernstein polynomial filters that can approximate arbitrary frequency responses, (2) adaptive spectral-spatial fusion that discovers optimal balance automatically, and (3) multi-view learning with view-specific optimization strategies.

Future work could explore attention-based fusion mechanisms, extend to other graph types (temporal, heterogeneous), and investigate theoretical connections between learned filters and collaborative filtering theory.
