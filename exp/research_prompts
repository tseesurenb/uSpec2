Here, I added model_double, we I tried to capture more insights through building negative similarity (this is my own novel idea where we can compare two users or items based on their uninteracted ones, while positive similarity is based on only interacted ones), but the performance is not improved and I assume maybe implementation is not correct. Especially this negative similarity should act as BPR which is common optimization techniques in CF. If so, the implementation should be different? Please think of your idea?
